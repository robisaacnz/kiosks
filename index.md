This repository holds configuration and policy information for remotely configuring instances of Porteus Kiosk.

If you have no special requirements, you can get good results by configuring an instance to use this management URL:

**https://robisaacnz.github.io/kiosks/generic**

That will configure an instance with:
* Wired ethernet connectivity
* An ad-blocker
* Sessions that end when the last window is closed
* Automatic cleanup

You can fork or otherwise borrow this repository as a template for managing your own instances.
